        **This endpoint allows you to remove a specific IP address from your IP whitelist.**

        When removing a specific IP address from your whitelist, you must include the ID in your call.

        IP Access Management allows you to control which IP addresses can be used to access your account, either through the User Interface or the API. There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that you can add to your whitelist. It is possible to remove your own IP address from the whitelist, thus preventing yourself from accessing your account.

        For more information, please see our [User Guide](http://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/ip_access_management.html).
